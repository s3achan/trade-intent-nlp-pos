It’s not just another blockchain it’s a REKT resistant, compliant Layer 1 built to make DeFi safe, reliable, and open for everyone.Here’s why Haven1 is different 👇- Control & Transparency :— You stay in charge of your assets with self custody, while still enjoying open access to the network.- Compliance Without Compromise :— One time KYC unlocks a world where users can still interact pseudonymously, but institutions get the assurance they need.- Next-Level Security :— Haven1 is built to stop the common DeFi problems: MEV, front running, and smart contract exploits. There are also fraud proofs and dispute mechanisms for extra safety.- Real World Connection :— Native support for stablecoins like USDC/EURC, integration with payment rails like SWIFT/SEPA, and DEXs that meet compliance standards.- Liquidity That Works for All :— By bridging institutional capital into DeFi, Haven1 unlocks deep, reliable markets that benefit both everyday users and big players.- Governance That Balances :— DAO driven upgrades with a regulatory advisory council. Decentralization and compliance working together, not against each other.And with products like @hSwap_H1 for seamless trading and @hEarn_H1 for secure, compliant yields, @Haven1official is already building the tools for adoption at scale.This isn’t just another chain.

It outclasses most projects completely. I am biased, but there is genuinely nothing like Kendu or even anything remotely close to it out there right now. And I honestly don\\'t know how anyone could replicate it. When the time is right and rotation starts happening from majors, Kendu will experience a dramatic repricing. And all this work, businesses, products, etc will come to fruition and make this time a little blip on the chart.Position accordingly, and if you\\'re curious about Kendu, this is the most opportune time to get involved.

To The Moonweeks ago i got paid $400+ for sharing a few thoughts on twitter (honest work)this is a significant amount in my local currency so i had to use an official bank account to receive it(something i rarely touch…who uses banks anyway?)to make sure this account could handle the deposit, i had to:> call customer service> wait 4 minutes to get connected> hand over all my personal data (govt name, date of birth, address, national ID, and more)> wait 2 hours for the info to be processed> get an email confirmation that everything was “good to go”unfortunately, that’s nearly 3 hours wasted to fix what the blockchain already handles in seconds.i think the world is far behind & our financial system will only improve once stablechains like @PlasmaFDN are officially integrated.this solves:- cheap, native storage for $USDT- independent ownership of funds- immediate access for onchain activityit might not seem like much to some, but for most of the world it saves real time & energy. i believe there’s a future where all financial companies will go stable, billions of users will go stable, trillions of dollars will be stable the world needs stablechains and plasma will definitely be at the forefront of all this.signed, trillions. 🕊️One of the biggest use cases of crypto that we\\'ve been screaming about for the past fifteen years is the US government using it to cement its data in a transparent way (spending next plzz?)And today they did exactly just thatIf you\\'re a holder of ANY of these coins, you had a huge win today.

Hashpower Wars (51% Race)Compete with rival cartels to reach majority control.Alliances and betrayals: mining pools merge mafia-style, then backstab when convenient.Military/economic warfare: drones, sabotage, sanctions, cyber-attacks.3. Wealth Accumulation PhaseBuy, steal, or seize Bitcoin to become a whale.Manage custody: cold wallets, multisig vaults, hardware protection.4. Purge & Domination PhaseOnce you hold enough, the rational move shifts:Instead of seizing rivals’ coins, you eliminate them (burn wallets, kill or imprison owners, crash their nodes).The fewer coins left in circulation, the more valuable yours become.5. EndgameAchieve majority supply + hashpower → rewrite the rules of money.Or fracture into chaos as rival forks split the network and civil wars erupt.$RAREThe same conviction will flow into RWAs. ...

ETH leads, $Vax follows with real-world utility.Trading against the herd is an art form most never learn…I’ll give you a tip on how to trade against the herd—because this is where most people lose and where the patient few build their edge.Scroll your timeline for a few minutes. Pay close attention to the voices calling every move on SOL (or any strong runner) “unsustainable,” “fake,” or “just a pump.” You’ll notice a pattern: these aren’t the ones inside the move, they’re the ones who missed it, the ones scrambling to justify why they didn’t catch it, or worse—why they’re still holding a short in denial.This is the exact moment where discipline separates winners from complainers. If you’re already in profit, this is often where you add to your position. Not blindly, not recklessly—but strategically, in alignment with your plan. Why? Because disbelief is fuel. Every excuse under the sun comes pouring out as we approach all-time highs. Traders start inventing reasons why the rally “can’t last.” They say it’s “different this time.” They anchor themselves to fear while price keeps grinding higher.The irony? These same voices will go quiet if we retrace 5%. Suddenly they’ll scream that the bull market is over, when in reality, pullbacks are part of every healthy structure. I’ve seen it cycle after cycle. They talk loud when they’re wrong, and they disappear when the chart proves them wrong.Remember: markets rise not because everyone believes, but because most don’t. The wall of worry is what price climbs. So when you see the flood of disbelief, don’t let it shake you—recognize it for what it is: evidence that you’re on the right side of the move.Trade with conviction. Add to winners, not losers. And never forget—the herd doesn’t guide you to success. It guides you straight into the slaughter. \\U0001faf5—Raleigh LaPlant, AKA Lil’ Whale 🐳Founder of Lil’ Whale Trading Inc.Behavioral Finance StrategistPYTH network selected by u.s. department of commerce to verify and distribute economic dataHuge potential! ... 💙0x94a5Cfc7517c67D634fF94A599E27CA9d87731f8 ...

They clearly have confidence in Bitcoin\\'s future.One of the strongest features of the CXT @Covalent_HQ economy is its revenue backed buyback mechanism. Unlike many tokens that rely on inflation or constant new issuance to incentivize participation, $CXT channels real revenue from the GoldRush API into the market itself.The protocol takes this revenue and executes direct market buys of $CXT,creating constant demand that is directly tied to the platform’s adoption and usage. Every time developers and institutions rely on the GoldRush API for block-chain data and real-time insights,they are indirectly fueling $CXT buy pressure.This dynamic flips the usual crypto model on its head instead of tokens being minted into circulation,tokens are consistently being bought back and removed.It’s a direct link between ecosystem success and token strength.Investors and holders can see with transparency that usage equals scarcity,making $CXT one of the few tokens with an intrinsic connection between revenue and supply reduction.this is a model that resembles stock buybacks in traditional finance but is automated,verifiable on-chain and designed to benefit the entire community of token holders.August 28, 19:00:00 to September 1, 18:59:59 (UTC+8)✍️Register for the event⬇️https://www.bitget.com/events/onchain-hunt/232299 ...

That’s retail vision. Institutions see something completely different: a lever on the future of AI itself.Here’s why:•Scarcity isn’t optional. TAO has a hard cap of 21M, and supply is already consolidating into long-term wallets. Thin float + whale accumulation = explosive upside once demand ignites.•It’s not a meme, it’s the meter. If AI is the new electricity, TAO is the meter — the unit of exchange for decentralized compute. Every inference, every model routed, every transaction: TAO is the gatekeeper.•Control is the real prize. Whoever controls TAO supply doesn’t just speculate — they influence which models run, which get silenced, and who gets access to decentralized AI power.That’s why this isn’t about hype cycles. This is about institutions. They don’t care about $360 vs $420. They care about owning the lever of decentralized AI governance.Retail asks, “Will TAO pump?” Institutions ask, “What happens if we don’t own it?” The answer is simple: if that lever must exist, then they must own it — no matter the cost.👌📢 Today’s WIN ranks are out!🏆 10,000,000 $USDT prize pool - Trade more.

Everyone who does a transaction sends their coins to the public blockchain. when you watch only it means you are scanning the blockchain for that address to see how many btc is in there.And to everyone who is now confused, I hope this edit fixes it. You are probably asking \"I thought bitcoin was decentralized, sending to blockchain sounds centralized\". So blockchain is a public ledger, when you send it to the blockchain, it means you are broadcasting it to everyone (technically it needs to be added by the miners but for this purpose it will do). This means every node will now know that you have sent this transaction thus makes it decentralized and important to run your own node.$USC 17K ➜ 336K 20x5️⃣. KCEX New Listings!

It\\'s pretty amazing to have a conference that brings together #Bitcoin enthusiasts from all around the world, in the vibrant city of #HongKong. 🇭🇰Day 1 had quite a few notable moments, with a lot of discussions focusing on regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, Asia\\'s share of global #crypto ownership, DATs vs ETFs and more. ✨Kicking off with a stellar opening by David Bailey (CEO of Kindly MD), here are a few highlights of Day 1 you shouldn\\'t miss. 😉⬇️1️⃣ In a session \\'Unveiling Korea\\'s Best Strategy\\' by Paul Lee, it was unveiled that #BitPlanet from Korea plans to buy $40 million worth of $BTC for its treasury! Adoption in #Korea is on the rise. 🇰🇷2️⃣ Asian adoption is on a positive growth trajectory. 📈 We\\'re seeing pro-digital asset policies in places like #Singapore, #Pakistan, and #HongKong. Now, there are talks of countries potentially accumulating Bitcoin to strengthen their reserves and forex, which will obviously push adoption even further! However, more foundational policy work has to be done before countries can explore establishing such #BitcoinReserves, so we\\'ll have to keep an eye out on how different regions progress. 3️⃣ Mark Moss, Chief Bitcoin Strategist at Satsuma, was quoted saying \\'$300 TRILLION is about to flow into Bitcoin\\'. 🔥4️⃣ There were quite a few discussions on Crypto #DATs vs Crypto #ETFs - just as a refresher, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) refer to publicly listed companies that strategically hold significant amounts of cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, #Ethereum, or #Solana) on their corporate balance sheets as a core treasury strategy. Speakers like Dr. Xiao Feng (CEO, #Hashkey) noted that DATs provide better liquidity and elasticity for investors. ✅The general consensus is that investors should consider ETFs for stock investments, but it may be better to explore DATs for their cryptocurrency investments. We\\'ll dive deeper into this topic in our upcoming content pipeline as there\\'s quite a bit to cover! 🤓BTW, even if you\\'re not in Hong Kong to attend in person, @BitcoinMagazine and @BitcoinConfAsia have been live streaming the conference on their X pages 🎥 so don\\'t miss out for Day 2 tomorrow! We ourselves can\\'t wait for tomorrow\\'s sessions, it\\'s definitely set to be another busy day ahead. Stay tuned for more recaps. 🥳#OAX #OAXLearn #BitcoinAsia2025 #BitcoinAsia #BitcoinCommunityWhen futures lean too bearish, it often sets the stage for surprise upside.

At the time, I faced mockery from various quarters as I began to engage with the topic, but this experience has taught me valuable lessons about resilience and the importance of learning.For me, this venture has never been solely about financial gain; rather, it has been about the comfort and knowledge that I have gained along the way. I genuinely believe that Bitcoin has the potential to experience significant growth, and I anticipate that it could reach over $140k. by mid-August. While I am uncertain about its ability to hit the $200 mark by then, I remain optimistic about its trajectory into the $140s by mid-October.Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective.

I\\'m not sure how the S-Curve adoption relates to btc, it\\'s an argument used often by permabulls. But is bitcoin really being adopted? and used?

It\\'s like you would talk of the adoption of gold, it just sounds weird.Sure if the whole world suddenly sees btc as the holy grail, the new store of value, and it gets hoarded by all major central banks, pension funds, it can go even to 1 milion this year.Safety first;- Never send your funds to an untrusted or unknown address, the team will never ask you for money or seedphrases.- There is no migration.
